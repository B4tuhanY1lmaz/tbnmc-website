Hello everyone, I'm Batuhan and today I got the summary of updates happened on October 2023.

## New Mods
- At September of 2023 we added the Terralith and Structory mods to our server for a better player experience but the world generation still lacked a lot of things in terms of Structories and world was still empty. Our point with this SMP is to give player a different experience than any other SMP servers out there and one way to do that is giving players structories to explore. And to do that. We added the [Yung's](https://modrinth.com/user/YUNGNICKYOUNG) mods to server.
	List of added mods:
	- [YUNG's Better Ocean Monuments](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-ocean-monuments)
	- [YUNG's Better Dungeons](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons)
	- [YUNG's Better Mineshafts](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts)
	- [YUNG's Better Strongholds](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds)
	- [YUNG's Better Jungle Temples](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-jungle-temples)
	- [YUNG's Bridges](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges)
	- [YUNG's Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras)

- Now it's possible to collect player heads with killing them thanks to [Just Player heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/just-player-heads) mod. 

## Server Improvements
- Server max player count has increased to 60.
- A bug that caused by a mod that resulted with Endermans wihout hitboxes has fixed.
- Players will be telepoerted to spawn while they're logging in. This has added to keep hidden places safe.
- Server spawn has moved to 15k, 15k to take new world generation mods take effect.
- Simple Voice chat has cancelled and it won't gonna added to server anytime soon.

So this was it for this month. Don't forget to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8dAHkxbKPf) and share your builds and discoveries with us!
